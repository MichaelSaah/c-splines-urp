Spent several hours in the weeds with the cubic spline interpolation scheme detailed in chaper IV of de Boor's book.

Implemented up to the banded matrix system in C.

Around this point, I realized that when interpolating points from a continuously differentiable function, we don't need to do all the work of estimating the coefficients.

Wrote up a quick poc in python and it seemed to work. Still need to compare error rates to SciPy implementation, but if this works, it will simplify implementation immensely.

Oscillation can get really bad when starting the interpolation on the steep part of the function, though it seems to stabilize when utilizing more than a critical number of points. It might make sense to do PCHIP on the steep part and regular cubics thereafter.
